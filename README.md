How it works:

### Task 2: Demonstrate List Slicing
This program demonstrates how to extract and reverse elements from a list using slicing in Python.

How it works:
- A list of numbers from 1 to 10 is created.
- The first five elements are extracted using slicing.
- These five elements are then reversed using slice notation.
- Both the extracted list and the reversed list are printed.
